Safety
======

**This page is written because a motor broke and we want to avoid breaking more motors. The PLs should have
implemented these rules before.**

Members should respect the following rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Members are **NOT** allowed to power the motors unless a PL is present or they were given explicit permission.
2. Members are **NOT** allowed to power the motors using the battery. **ONLY** with a power supply when a PL is present or
   when they were given permission.
3. .. raw:: html

      <b><span style="color:red;">If the current is maxing out, IMMEDIATELY shut off the power supply. Failure to do so will result in broken hardware.</span></b>

4. Run `sudo poweroff` before turning off the power. This rule is to be ignored if the current is maxing out and rule 3 should be respected.
