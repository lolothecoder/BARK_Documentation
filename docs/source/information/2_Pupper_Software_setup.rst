Pupper Software Setup
=====================

To connect to the Pi make sure you are on the `SPOT-iot wifi <https://make.epfl.ch/tools/iot-wifi.php/>`_.

Then to ssh onto the Pi type:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh pi@pupper

**Password:** pupper

For the Labs, click the links below, it would bring you to the official Standford Labs page for Pupper:  `Standford Pupper Labs <https://cs123-stanford.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Each lab is divided per week and it teaches you the basics of ROS and Inverse Kinematics. The labs are meant for gorups of 2 to 3 peoples, since we have just one dog, try your best to give to everyone the possibility to work on it and to test their own code :).
