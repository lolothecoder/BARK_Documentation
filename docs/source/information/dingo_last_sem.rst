What was done on DINGO?
=======================

Last semester we wanted to finish up DINGO and give it to PAWS to program. However, that failed for a multitude of reasons
including: lack of clear tasks for team members, lack of documentations, organization, miscommunications and delays in shipments.
This year we hope to improve. 

Quick Bullet points of what we did: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Attempt to add encoders to the motors to have feeback
* Reprint the legs
* Simple code on Arduino to make the legs move

We lost a lot of time on the encoders. We should have just purchased servos with encoders. Or at least we should
have built the basic DINGO first, then get it to move, then encoders.
