What was done on DINGO?
=======================

Last semester, our goal was to complete DINGO and hand it over to the PAWS team for programming. Unfortunately, we encountered several challenges that prevented us from reaching that milestone. Some of the main obstacles included:

* Unclear task assignments within the team
* Insufficient documentation and organization
* Miscommunications
* Delays in component shipments

Quick Bullet points of what we did: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Attempt to add encoders to the motors to have feeback
* Reprint the legs
* Simple code on Arduino to make the legs move

One major lesson was the significant time spent troubleshooting the encoders. In hindsight, purchasing servos with built-in encoders or focusing first on building a basic, moving DINGO before adding advanced features would have been more efficient.
