**Accessing the DINGO**
-----------------------

At the moment, we are keeping the DINGO and the parts in 2 lockers in Stock 1 at the SPOT. The codes
for the locks are in our WhatsApp groupchat description. You are allowed to work on the DINGO whenever you want.
But if you are not sure of something, ask someone who knows. We would like to avoid breaking things.
