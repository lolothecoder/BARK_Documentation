**TLDR**: We are still making DINGO crouch and we are using the offcial wiring.

**Location** : DLL

**Members present** Johann, Loïc, Liam, Christy, Maxime, Anaïs, Luis, Louis, Adam

Annouced the new work session on Thursday @ 4pm. Explained the big changes such as that we are now using the offcial wiring
therefore the motors are receiving commands from the raspberry pi. Louis and Maxime don't have that many tasks, they will
get more when Pupper comes. Pupper parts are supposed to come 21.10.2025. Had to break a lock for a locker since the
code was accidentally changed. Christy had bronchitis (sad). Asked bosses about having access on the weekend to SPOT.
