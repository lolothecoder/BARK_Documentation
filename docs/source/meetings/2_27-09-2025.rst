Ordered the full part kits for Pupper v3. They will be shipped mid october.
Everyone needs to think of some ideas for a smaller project. Johnan suggested to make a starter kit
which is a cool idea. He proposed a simple device tht would track an object and move using 2 servos.
Loïc explained to everyone how to modify the website. Everyone was explained their tasks. They have
